  this algorithms performs a multiplication of a and b

  while x > 0:
    if x % 2 == 1: 
      z = z + y # when x is odd, set z
    y = y << 1 # bit shift, equivalent to double y

# the number of times the loop will run is the number of times
# it will take to bit shift x until it reaches 0. (subtract 1, then
# divide by 2). This is floor(log2a) + 1.
