'''
  A graph that can be drawn on a plane such that the edges don't cross.

  Relationship between the number of nodes and edges in a planar graph:
  nodes - edges + regions == 2
  This is another Euler formula.
  (regions are areas bounded by edges, including the area outside the graph)

  Growth rate of a planar graph:
